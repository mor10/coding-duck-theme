# Coding Duck VS Code Theme (Light/Dark)

Author: [Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://github.com/mor10)

A duo of VS Code Themes – Coding Duck Light and Coding Duck Dark – to celebrate our broad-beaked feathery friends.

These themes are a personal project and will be randomly updated and otherwise left largely untouched. Act accordingly.
